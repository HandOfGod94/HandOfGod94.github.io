title: Empathy and Pair Programming

> The views expressed are my personal opinions and is in no way to harm other.

### First few questions:
- How many times have you lost your temper during code reviews?
- Do you feel your contribution is the best/worst in the team?

If yes, please follow along.

Emapthy: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.

Our industry requires continuous interaction with our coworkers even though the output or 
product that we produce is non-tangible. Why?

The problems our industry is trying to solve is highly coupled with interactions of humankind.
- not able to get a cab. Solution: Uber/Ola/Gojek/Grab
- forgot your wallet, or don't have monetary change. Solution: Paytm/UPI/Gopay/Grabpay
- want to gift a book to someone, but is not available at local bookstore. Don't worry, you can
  probably get it from Amazon and it will delivered to you within a day.

All of these experiences that tech enables us, requires problem solvers to connect with people experiencing these
problems aka **EMPATHY**.

But why is it required for devs? isn't PMs/Sales/Marketing/Researchers are suppose to connect with people
so that us introverted devs can stay happily in our caves?

**Great products or great solutions requires great leaders and great teams.**

### How do we define great team?
If you google this, most of the answers will include:
A team which communicates well, feels at home with their peers, everyone contributes blah blah..

> A team, is not siloed groups.  
> We can't and shouldn't differentiate ourself as dev team, qa team, PM team,
> sales team within the team.  
> Team consist of everyone, dev, QA, PMs, sales, marketing and anyone else who work with you
> on a regular basis.

Now how to achieve these standards, where we communicate well, feels at home with among our peers,
nobody over-contributes or under-contributes?

**I believe the solution might be an effective pair programming, because it induces empathy.**

In my experience with pair programming, it made me more connected to my co-workers because of
continuous engagement with him/her. I know and understand what he/she is going through. I can quickly fill-in 
for them during their absence or when they are having bad day, and I have assurance that they will do it for me.  
**Coming full circle, original definition of empathy: Ability to share and understand feelings of another.**

### Why I think code-reviews are not good at encouraging empathy?
- It doesn't encourage face-to-face/sync communication. (I'm not saying it doesn't encourage communication).
  
Many folks would want to do it async and over comments on PR. Even if it's on call, I believe it will hardly
last more than 1-2 hours.  
In my experience it had led to lots of misunderstanding and clashes among peers.  
The reviewer gets frustrated by repeating same thing every-time and devs gets frustrated 
because of context switch and redo/undo they have to do whenever there is a comment on a PR.

- It's not suitable for company or org, even though it's effective for open source development.

IMO, all the other benefits (like no-code reviews, faster checkins) which pair-programming 
provides are secondary.

The primary outcome and the goal, for pair programming should be:

> I feel like I'm part of a team where I know and understand everyone, and thus can collaborate effectively.

Us humans have inherent need to connect with people around. Even the most introverted person
needs some social interaction.  
P.S. I consider myself ambivert, inclined toward introversion.
